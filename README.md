# Kube-Auth

Kube-auth is an open source desktop app to manage authentication and authorization on any kubernetes cluster.

The idea of this project is to have an application which allows kubernetes administrator to manage access and authorization in an easy and less-complex way, all the functionality is based on what kubernetes supports thus there is no need to install an custom operator or controller, for authorization we use RBAC model by invoking the API and for authentication is currently managed by x509 certs authentication.


## Kubernetes Supported

The application has been tested with the following kubernetes flavors:

* RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine)
* Kubernetes kubeadm


#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.jsÂ®` and an `npm` package manager.
